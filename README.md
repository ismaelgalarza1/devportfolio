A simple React + typescript portfolio website that show my projects and contact me. It was really fun to make and I learned a lot from this experince. Used React PDF to display my resume and give the viewer the option to download it.

As the time goes by I plan on adding more features to this website and make it more interactive and user friendly. I also plan on adding more projects and experiences to the website.
